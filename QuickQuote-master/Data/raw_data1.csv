Client received standard NS in mid-XXXX due to cholesterol of XXX, ratio X.X.  Her LDL was XXX but she has responded well to medication and her LDL on the most recent lab done with doctor (July XXXX) was at XX, with a total cholesterol of XXX, and HDL at XX.  Her triglycerides on the most recent testing were elevated at XXX.  Her health history is otherwise unremarkable.

Providing no interim changes in health, and good results on new insurance exam to be done in conjunction with application, could you consider for Preferred NS or would Standard be the best possible outcome?
